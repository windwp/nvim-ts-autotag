# nvim-ts-autotag

Use treesitter to **autoclose** and **autorename** html tag

It works with:

- astro
- glimmer
- handlebars
- html
- javascript
- jsx
- markdown
- php
- rescript
- svelte
- tsx
- twig
- typescript
- vue
- xml

and more

## Usage

```text
Before        Input         After
------------------------------------
<div           >              <div></div>
<div></div>    ciwspan<esc>   <span></span>
------------------------------------
```

## Setup

Requires `Nvim 0.9.5` and up.

```lua
require('nvim-ts-autotag').setup({
  opts = {
    -- Defaults
    enable_close = true, -- Auto close tags
    enable_rename = true, -- Auto rename pairs of tags
    enable_close_on_slash = false -- Auto close on trailing </
  },
  -- Also override individual filetype configs, these take priority.
  -- Empty by default, useful if one of the "opts" global settings
  -- doesn't work well in a specific filetype
  per_filetype = {
    ["html"] = {
      enable_close = false
    }
  }
})
```

### Extending the default config

Let's say that there's a language that `nvim-ts-autotag` doesn't currently support and you'd like to support it in your
config. While it would be the preference of the author that you upstream your changes, perhaps you would rather not ðŸ˜¢.

For example, if you have a language that has a very similar layout in its Treesitter Queries as `html`, you could add an
alias like so:

```lua
require('nvim-ts-autotag').setup({
  aliases = {
    ["your language here"] = "html",
  }
})

-- or
local TagConfigs = require("nvim-ts-autotag.config.init")
TagConfigs:add_alias("your language here", "html")
```

That will make `nvim-ts-autotag` close tags according to the rules of the `html` config in the given language.

But what if a parser breaks for whatever reason, for example the upstream Treesitter tree changes its node names and now
the default queries that `nvim-ts-autotag` provides no longer work.

Fear not! You can directly extend and override the existing configs. For example, let's say the start and end tag
patterns have changed for `xml`. We can directly override the `xml` config:

```lua
local TagConfigs = require("nvim-ts-autotag.config.init")
TagConfigs:update(TagConfigs:get("xml"):override("xml", {
    start_tag_pattern = { "STag" },
    end_tag_pattern = { "ETag" },
}))
```

In fact, this very nearly what we do during our own internal initialization phase for `nvim-ts-autotag`.

### Enable update on insert

If you have that issue
[#19](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-ts-autotag/issues/19)

```lua
vim.lsp.handlers['textDocument/publishDiagnostics'] = vim.lsp.with(
    vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_publish_diagnostics,
    {
        underline = true,
        virtual_text = {
            spacing = 5,
            severity_limit = 'Warning',
        },
        update_in_insert = true,
    }
)
```

## Fork Status

This is forked from https://github.com/windwp/nvim-ts-autotag due to the primary maintainer's disappearance. Any
PRs/work given to this fork _may_ end up back in the original repository if the primary maintainer comes back.

Full credit to [@windwp](https://github.com/windwp) for the creation of this plugin. Here's to hoping they're ok and will be back sometime down the line.
